# SayMyName
A program that waits to hear your name to play your voice message


## Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/cBRWWGc8vfQ
# The app listens to ambient sounds and notifies you if someone calls your name.
    "Please say your name, then I will start listenning to voices around if they say your name, then I will say your message. To exit the program, say exit"

usage:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python3 app.py
3. say your name after listening to the welcome message (after you see Listening message on the screen)
4. wait to see if your name correctly recognized (when the cow writes your name in the screen)
5. then record your voice message for 5 sec (this willl be played when your name is called)
6. minimize the app and don't worry, because the program listens to your name instead of you and will be present in the class instead of you :)
