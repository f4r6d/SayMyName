# SayMyName
A program that waits to hear your name to play your voice message


## Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/cBRWWGc8vfQ
# The app listens to ambient sounds and notifies you if someone calls your name.
    "Please say your name, then I will start listenning to voices around if they say your name, then I will say your message. To exit the program, say exit"
